With the growing awareness about the importance of hygienic beverage options, the demand for bottled options is also increasing, thereby creating avenues for the bottled water market growth in the region.\href{https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/bottled-water-market}{(Source)}

\textit{\textbf{United States}}\par
In the United States, the bottled water market has hit new peaks in both volume and sales as of 2022, showcasing a growing preference for bottled water among consumers. The market value was reported at USD 22.175 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.42\% from 2022 to 2030. The overall market size for bottled water in the US is expected to grow from USD 316.76 billion in 2023 to USD 426.70 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 6.14\% during the forecast period (2023-2028). North America made the second-largest contribution to the global market with a revenue share of 23.9\% in 2022. The growing trend of living a healthy lifestyle and extensive sports and other physical and outdoor activities are also responsible for the high demand for bottled water. Most Americans do not prefer drinking water straight from the tap as they find packaged options to be a safer and more convenient option. Moreover, the rising demand for eco-friendly and sustainable packaging solutions by customers is expected to offer lucrative opportunities for existing manufacturers and new entrants in the market. In 2022, the U.S. accounted for 57.7\% of the market share. People are now more conscious about their health and are realizing the significance of consuming nutritious beverages. Bottled water is being recognized as a better choice compared to sugary drinks.\href{https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/bottled-water-market}{(Source)}

\textit{\textbf{Caribbean}}\par
The revenue in the Bottled Water segment in the Caribbean amounts to USD 1.76 billion in 2023, with an expected annual growth rate of 4.89\% (CAGR 2023-2027). However, the Latin American bottled water market (which includes the Caribbean) saw a modest decline in 2022, waning by -2.2\% against the previous year, which might reflect regional variations in market trends. The bottled water market in both the US East and the Caribbean region is exhibiting growth, albeit with different market dynamics and growth rates.

\textit{\textbf{Europe}}\par
Europe is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.2\% from 2022 to 2030. The tourism industry plays a significant role in driving the demand for the market in Europe. With millions of tourists visiting European countries each year, the need for reliable and safe drinking water is essential. Bottled water offers a convenient solution for both domestic and international tourists who may be unsure about the quality of tap water in unfamiliar destinations. Germany is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7\% during the forecast period. The market is poised for growth primarily due to increasing awareness among individuals about the significance of maintaining proper hydration. Moreover, there is a rising demand for premium bottled water as people seek healthier options. Furthermore, the fact that consumers now have higher disposable incomes adds to the expansion of the market.\href{https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/bottled-water-market}{(Source)}

\section{Demand Analysis Local | Regional | International}
\subsection{Local Demand}
The local population of the Bahamas also forms a key part of the target market for bottled water. Many Bahamians may prefer bottled water for its convenience and perceived purity, particularly where tap water quality is a concern. Also, the UN predicts a slight growth in the population of the Bahamas until 2048 and will have a decreasing trend from 2048 to 2100. There is no significant growth in the total population. However, due to the little marginal revenue of the traditional plastic bottled water (average price of \$1 per bottle), \textbf{the locals might not become our major source of income.} 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{7.png}
\caption{Historical demographics of The Bahamas }
\label{fig:unique_label_8}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tourists and Visitors}
The Bahamas is an international tourist destination with visitors from around the world. The USA is the largest tourist contributor making up  80\% of the visitors. Historical data shows that March will be the month with the highest number of visitor arrivals, while in September there are the fewest tourists. (Source? Footnote/endnote?) 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{8.png}
\caption{The Bahamas Visitor Data 2010-2023 Based on Island}
\label{fig:unique_label_8}
\end{figure}

The aggregated data from 2010 to September 2023 shows / suggests that New Providence Island became the largest tourist attraction with 54\% contributors, followed by The \textbf{Out Islands | Family Islands (to which Andros belongs) with 35\% and Grand Bahama by 11\%}. The pie chart below shows the tourist distribution between the three islands. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{9.png}
\caption{Proportion of visitors on each Island}
\label{fig:unique_label_9}
\end{figure}

Andros does not attract the most tourists, as shown by the monthly visitor lists over the last 13 years. Based on this aggregated data, from the total number of tourists, who came to the Bahamas, only 0.17\% visited Andros. However, Andros is the major island of The Bahamas in respect to size and in respect to readily available freshwater. In order to protect through a social, environmental, and economic beneficial stewardship program this pressures the natural resource of Andros. \textbf{The intent is to choose Andros Island as our base for the sourcing and distribution of “BA Water” to The Bahamas islands, the region, and the world. }

\begin{table}[h]

\end{figure}




\subsubsection{The Predictive Trend on Visitors}  

The Bahamas suffered significant financial loss due to the pandemic as their main industry is tourism, but they bounced back fast and the 2023 year-to-date data already shows positive trends compared to the pre-pandemic area.\par
Tourism in the Bahamas for the upcoming years forecasts a growth trend. Estimated tourist trend for the next 20 years based on the last 10 years’ historical data excluding the pandemic area, shows that the estimated visitor per month in the Bahamas area, the maximum, minimum, and average visitor per month per year have a distribution as follows. (Source – footnote where the data is coming from.) \par

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
Statistic & Value \\

Max & 975,863 \\
Min & 597,501 \\
Average & 805,389.8 \\

\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{11.png}
\caption{Different Scenarios }
\label{fig:unique_label_11}
\end{figure}

From the literature review, \textbf{almost 70\% Bahamas visitors a day visitor, and stop-over visitors contribute to the remaining 30\%,} the stop-over visitors’ expected stays in the islands are around 7 days on average, which gives the next point of view: 

\subsubsection{The Cruise Ships} 
Securing business with cruise ship companies entails extensive effort, communication, and negotiation. The Bahamas welcomed \hl{\textbf{over 3.2 million}} cruise passengers in 2022, with hopes of increasing this number to over 4 million in 2023. The average capacity of ocean liners, which are the primary type of cruise ships visiting the Bahamas, is around 3,000 guests. Since the restart of cruising in 2021, the Nassau Cruise Port has received 1,592 cruise ship calls.\par

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{12.jpg}
\caption{The Bahamas Cruise Ships}
\label{fig:unique_label_11}
\end{figure}
Assuming an average capacity of 3,000 passengers per ship and 3.2 million cruise passengers in a year. \hl{Cruise passengers would constitute approximately \textbf{52.20\% }of the total tourists}.\textbf{The estimated annual number of cruise ships visiting the Bahamas is approximately 1,067.} That gives us a strong hint that it would be advantageous if our project could directly engage with the cruise ship companies to discern their potential demand and explore the feasibility of sourcing from a local bottling plant.

\subsubsection{Conclusion Market and Market Segment Analysis }
The data shows the expected market for normal bottled water in the Bahamas every year, \textbf{including the stops by tourists(cruise ships, hotels), the local population, and long-term visitors):}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{High-end bottled water Line}
High-end bottled water can have a gross profit margin that is six to seven times higher than that of regular bottled water, largely due to higher pricing strategies. However, not all water could be made “Premium”.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Purity:} The location of the source plays a significant role in the purity of the water. Remote, pollution-free environments far from industrial or agricultural activities are preferred to minimize the risk of contamination.
    
    \item \textbf{Natural Filtration:} Many premium waters come from aquifers where the water has been naturally filtered through rock formations, which can add beneficial minerals and remove impurities.
    
    \item \textbf{Mineral Content:} The specific mineral content, which can include elements like calcium, magnesium, and silica, is often a selling point. The balance of these minerals not only contributes to the taste but also to the health benefits claimed by the brands.
    
    \item \textbf{Regulation and Sustainability:} Access to water sources is regulated by governments, which can limit the availability of premium sources. Sustainable management of the source is also crucial to maintain its purity and availability for future generations.
    
    \item \textbf{Branding and Story:} The origin of the water often forms a significant part of the brand story, and exotic or pristine sources are marketed as being superior, contributing to the premium image of the product.
    
    \item \textbf{Certification:} Certain certifications can be obtained that attest to the quality and handling of the water, such as spring water or artesian water, which can justify a higher price point.
\end{enumerate}

The combination of these factors means that not all mineral waters can be marketed as premium. The premium label is reserved for those who can offer exceptional purity, a unique mineral composition, and often a compelling story about their origin.

The likelihood of water from Bahama Andros Island being classified as 'Premium' is slim. Premium waters are esteemed resources and often gain renown for their quality. If such status were applicable, it would likely be well-known; hence, without existing recognition, it is improbable that the water meets the 'Premium' criterion.

\section{Project: Market – Business Analysis}
\subsection{Differentiation: Grenn, Just, Healthy and Diverse}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Green | Good Cause: Protecting Natural Resource Water\par
  The establishment of a bottling plant in the Bahamas presents a unique opportunity to model sustainable practices in the beverage industry. This project is committed to preserving the delicate island ecosystem by utilizing environmentally friendly materials and innovative energy sources while minimizing the impact on local water resources.\par
  The bottling plant \textbf{will utilize fully paper-based and biodegradable materials for packaging.} This initiative significantly reduces plastic waste and contributes to a more sustainable environment. Table \ref{tab:material_use} outlines the types of materials and their environmental benefits.\par
  \begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Sustainable Materials and Environmental Benefits}
\label{tab:material_use}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Material} & \textbf{Environmental Benefit} \\
\hline
Biodegradable Packaging & Reduces plastic waste and pollution in the ocean. \\
\hline
Recycled Paper & Lowers the demand for virgin wood pulp, reducing deforestation. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The bottling plant will \textbf{implement a rainwater harvesting system }to efficiently utilize the abundant rainfall in the Bahamas. This approach significantly reduces the need for groundwater extraction, preserving the island's natural water resources.\par
To minimize the environmental footprint, \textbf{the plant will harness renewable energy sources }such as tidal and wind power. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also sets a precedent for sustainable energy use in industrial operations.\par

Sustainable energy in the Bahamas is crucial for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reducing energy trade and increasing energy security: The Bahamas heavily depends on imported fossil fuels for energy. Shifting to sustainable energy sources reduces this dependence.
    \item Mitigating climate change: Fossil fuel combustion contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power emit fewer greenhouse gases.
    \item Reducing air pollution: Fossil fuels release harmful pollutants. Sustainable energy sources promote cleaner air.
    \item Economic benefits: Transitioning to sustainable energy stimulates economic growth, job creation, and clean energy technology development.
\end{enumerate}

The suitability of sustainable power generators in the Bahamas depends on local factors like climate, geography, and energy needs. Here are some generally suitable options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Solar Power: Abundant in the sunny Bahamas, photovoltaic solar panels can be installed on rooftops, open land, and water surfaces.
    \item Wind Turbines: Consistent trade winds make wind turbines viable for electricity production.
    \item Hydropower: Some islands have suitable water resources for small-scale hydropower.
    \item Ocean and Tidal Energy: Strong ocean currents and tides can be harnessed for sustainable energy.
\end{itemize}

Comprehensive site assessments and feasibility studies are necessary for each region. Factors like wind patterns, solar radiation, water access, energy demand, and infrastructure influence the choice of renewable sources. Supportive policies and incentives from the Bahamian government are crucial.

Currently, we focus on \textbf{Wind Turbines as a power generator}. A SWOT diagram for Wind Turbine Power Generators is created based on online literature.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{32.png}
\caption{SWOT of Wind Turbines}
\label{fig:image1}
\end{figure}

Wind Turbines seems suitable for the Bahamas, as this has been implemented in some country in the Caribbean which has a similar condition to the Bahamas, so we assume that this sustainable energy has a high probability of suiting the Bahamas' condition, from our literature review, we found 9 countries in the Caribbean which implemented Wind Turbine Power Generator.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{33.png}
